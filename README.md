Hello there, welcome to my page! I’ve chosen to compare the score of horror and romance . For horror i’ve chosen for the classic movie ‘’The Shining’’ from 1980, directed by Stanley Kubrick, and for romance ive chosen "Amélie’’ from 2001, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. These movies are highly rated on IMDB (whitin own genre) and therefore representable for it’s genre. I have chosen for horror because i think it will be interesting to see the results, especially if you compare it to its opposite genre: romance.
For this case i want to use Rmarkdown in combination with the Spotify API. For the storyboard i'm gonnna use flexdashboard. 
Tracks that are interested for this research are both intro themes for each movie.
